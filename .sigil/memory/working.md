## Pipeline State: Active Execution

### Recent Activity
**PRs Opened (8):**
- #270: Refactor executor branch sentinel to Optional[str] (small type fix)
- #271: Sigil Situation Room: Real-time terminal observability dashboard
- #272: Harden apply_edit against empty old_content hallucinations
- #273: Fix urllib→httpx inconsistency in LLM module
- #274: Fix inconsistent type hints in _extract_tc function
- #275: Type-safe tool call extraction in LLM module
- #276: Harden _extract_tc against missing object attributes
- #277: Agent Tool Call Retry Guidance — Structured error messages help agents self-correct

**Execution Results:**
- 6 PRs succeeded (type fixes, dashboard, edit hardening, httpx consistency, attribute hardening, retry guidance)
- 2 ideas downgraded to issues after 4 retries each:
  - `.sigilignore` filtering logic (implementation complexity)
  - Persistent veto memory (state management challenges)

### What Didn't Work
- **Complex state management**: Both failed executions involved tracking state across runs (veto memory, ignore patterns). The pipeline struggles with persistent state beyond a single session.
- **Over-engineering**: The `.sigilignore` implementation attempted to replicate full `.gitignore` semantics rather than starting with simple pattern matching.
- **Retry limits**: Both failures hit the 4-retry limit, suggesting fundamental design issues rather than implementation bugs.

### Patterns & Insights
1. **Type safety fixes are low-hanging fruit**: Simple type annotations and narrowing execute cleanly (0-2 retries).
2. **Centralization pays off**: Fixing `_extract_tc()` eliminated duplicate hybrid dict/object parsing logic in three other functions.
3. **State is hard**: Any feature requiring cross-session persistence faces architectural challenges.
4. **Async consistency matters**: The codebase uses `urllib.request` for simple HTTP calls; `httpx` is not a project dependency.
5. **Defensive programming works**: Adding `hasattr` checks before attribute access prevents crashes without changing API semantics.
6. **Structured errors improve agent behavior**: Returning actionable guidance in error messages (not just bare strings) lets agents self-correct on tool call failures — 0 retries needed.
7. **Execution velocity strong**: 8 PRs opened across recent runs; focus on concrete fixes continues to pay off.

### What to Focus On Next Run
1. **Address remaining technical debt**: Look for dead code, missing tests, and actual runtime issues.
2. **Avoid stateful features**: Steer clear of proposals requiring persistent memory or cross-session tracking.
3. **Maintain type safety momentum**: Continue fixing unsafe type hints and attribute access patterns.
4. **Reject large architectural proposals**: Keep PRs small and immediately actionable; complex features belong in issues.
5. **Focus on robustness**: Look for other places where `getattr` or direct attribute access on `Any`/`object` types could fail.
6. **Expand structured error patterns**: Where else can error messages be enriched to guide agent self-correction? Apply the same pattern to other tool failure modes.

**Key Metric**: All validated findings from previous runs have been addressed. Focus shifts to proactive quality improvements and expanding the structured error guidance pattern to other tool interfaces.
